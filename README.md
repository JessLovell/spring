# Spring Web Application

## Packages, Products, etc.
[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with dependencies web, thymeleaf, devTools, postgreSQL.       
[Deployed Heroku site](https://cryptic-journey-45375.herokuapp.com/) is currently an error page. 

## The Challenge
### Day 1
1. Create a `hello world` route at `/hello`, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see data come back.
2. Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit `/capitalize/hello` and get back the response `HELLO`, or I could visit `/capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized` and get the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.

### Day 2
1. Create an Album model with a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that albumâ€™s art.
2. A user should be able to see information about all the albums on the site.
3. A user should be able to add albums to the site.
4. **Stretch Goal:** A user should be able to update information about albums on the site. A user should be able to delete albums on the site.
